## Hello, hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at the [MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research](https://space.mit.edu/) passionate about studying the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe. My research involves developing machine learning techniques to analyze large cosmological simulations and observational data.

Currently, I'm working with [Prof. Lina Necib](https://lnecib.com/) at MIT. From August 2022 to January 2023, I was a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at the Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) at the Simons Foundation, collaborating with [Prof. Rachel Sommerville](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/people/rachel-somerville/) in the Galaxy Formation group.

### Projects I'm Involved In:

1. **Inferring Dark Matter Density Profiles:** Applying graph-based simulation-based inference to infer the dark matter density profiles of dwarf galaxies [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12825)].

2. **Generating Dark Matter Halo Merger Trees:** Generating dark matter halo merger trees using recurrent flow-based generative models [[icml](uploads/florah_icml_camready.pdf)].

3. **Characterizing Milky Way Accretion History:** Using kinematics of accreted stars to characterize the galaxy accretion history of the Milky Way.

4. **Constructing Synthetic Gaia DR3 Surveys:** Creating synthetic Gaia DR3 surveys from Milky Way-like galaxies in the FIRE simulation.

Feel free to explore my work and learn more about the exciting discoveries in astrophysics and cosmology!
